# Ping-application
This is a python code that will create custom ICMP packets and send requests to any domain for ping.
In this task, I created my own ping application, where I can ping IP and domain names of different
websites, I used socket programming in Python to develop the code, although there were many
challenges that I had to encounter and I had to take some help to understand the logic of Checksum
calculation. Overall, there was a lot to learn from this task.
